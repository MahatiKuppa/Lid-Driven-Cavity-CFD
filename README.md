# Lid-Driven Cavity Flow Simulation using ANSYS Fluent

## Overview

This project demonstrates a classic CFD problem: the **lid-driven cavity flow**. The flow is generated inside a square cavity where the top lid moves at a constant velocity, driving the fluid motion within the cavity. The objective is to simulate the velocity field and understand vortex formation due to shear forces at the moving lid.

## Problem Description

- **Geometry:** 1 m Ã— 1 m square cavity.
- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - **Top lid:** Moves horizontally with a constant velocity (e.g., 0.001 m/s).
  - **Other walls:** Stationary with no-slip condition (velocity = 0).
- **Fluid:** Incompressible, Newtonian fluid - water, with standard properties.
- **Flow Regime:** Laminar flow simulated at low Reynolds number.

## Software & Tools Used

- **ANSYS Fluent 2025 R2 Student Edition** for simulation and post-processing.
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and project hosting.

---

## Running the Simulation

1. Open the Fluent case file (`.cas`) in ANSYS Fluent.
2. Set solver parameters (pressure-based, steady-state, laminar).
3. Initialize the solution and run the simulation until convergence.
4. Use Fluent post-processing tools to generate velocity contours and streamline plots.
5. Export relevant images and data for analysis.

---

## Key Results

- The velocity contours show the formation of a **primary vortex** in the center of the cavity.
- Smaller **secondary vortices** appear near the bottom corners.
- Velocity magnitude decreases from the moving lid toward stationary walls, consistent with expected physical behavior.
- The simulation results can be compared with benchmark solutions from literature for validation.
